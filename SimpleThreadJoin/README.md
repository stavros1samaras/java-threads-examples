ðŸ§µ Simple Thread Join Example

This program demonstrates how to create and run two threads in Java.
It uses the join() method to make sure the main thread waits for both threads to finish.
Perfect for learning basic thread creation and synchronization.

ðŸ§µ Thread Output Control

This example runs 20 threads (10 from class A, 10 from B).
Each prints a multiplication table based on its ID.
It shows how output gets mixed without control, and how join() helps manage the execution order.
